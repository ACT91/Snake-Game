# Snake-Game
This project is a modernized version of the classic Snake game, developed using Python and the Pygame library.

The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The game features improved graphics, including a splash screen, rounded snake segments, a shiny food effect, a border around the play area, and a real-time score display.


Key Features:
Splash Screen: Displays “Developed by ACT91” at startup.
Modern Graphics: Rounded snake, shiny food, and a bordered play area.
Score Display: The player’s score is shown in real time.
Game Over Screen: Informs the player of their final score and offers options to quit or play again.
Responsive Controls: Use the arrow keys to control the snake’s direction.


How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
Eat the green food to grow longer and increase your score.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake’s own body.
Try to achieve the highest score possible!


Requirements:
Python 3.x
